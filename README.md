For Challenge A there are no dependencies needed to run the code. I was able to make A1 work partially to the point where
it grabbed the quotes from the website and made it into a dictionary but wasn't able to make it run for A1 and A2.
For A3 I installed K3s in an Instance from atmosphere and the K3S service was running as well as nats was up and
running but the Kubernetes resources wasn't. The ip address is 128.196.142.27  

For challenge B i was only able to complete B1 partially and only
had one file.
